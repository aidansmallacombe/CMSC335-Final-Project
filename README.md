App Description: 
Welcome to MovieRecs! Our site allows users to get movie recomendations based on what they search for. To start, search up a movie title or genre, and the site will populate the page with recommendations gathered from an API. Note that from this page, users can make additional searches from the same page which will result in new data. Each recommendation will have a section where users can select 1 or more watchlists to add a movie to. There are four watchlists: Favorites, Planned, Watched, and On Hold. To add a movie to a watchlist, select 1 (or more) watchlists you want to add the current movie to, and click the button next to it labeled "Add to Watchlist". The watchlist data is sent to our server on MongoDB. To view movies in your watchlists, select "My Watchlists" underneath the search bar on the home page.
