YouTube Video Link: https://youtu.be/qOrf2Dq9Qy0 (youtube took this video down because it thinks I was advertising a movie pirating site. I appealed, but the appeal will take up to 72 hours. I have posted to Piazza with no response yet, but I have emailed Nelson with the direct video file. Please understand that this is out of our control, and even though a video is required it, we have in fact recorded the video and attempted to send it in some other way. For questions, please email me at the contact email below.)
